# stormwaterGUI
## **the AWS RDS database has been deleted**
Displaying the AWS RDS Stormwater database from the stormwaterloop repository through a GUI. The user inputs a parcelid and outputs the contents of the SQL statement in the submit_fid() function or the for loop index retrieval method included as the test() function. The AWS RDS database has been deleted to avoid any cost accruals and unauthorized access, therefore the model function, test() has been developed and used as the GUI command to mimic the retrieval and output from the user input in the GUI using a list and for loop function. 


The .py file is included in the repository and the two jpeg images are included to exhibit the input, ouput, and GUI. The jpeg image named *"TkinterGUI_DBStormwater_pic.jpg"* exhibits the GUI and the jpeg image named *"Input_OutputTkinterGUI.jpg"* exhibits the input from the GUI and its output in the console.


*still in design processing. the code is not 100% complete*
