# stormwaterGUI
Displaying the AWS RDS Stormwater database from the stormwaterloop repository through a GUI. The AWS RDS database has been deleted to avoid any cost accruals and unauthorized access, therefore a model function has been developed to mimic the retrieval and output from the user input in the GUI using a list and for loop function.
