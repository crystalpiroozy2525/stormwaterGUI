# stormwaterGUI
## **the AWS RDS database has been deleted**
Displaying the AWS RDS Stormwater database from the stormwaterloop repository through a GUI. The AWS RDS database has been deleted to avoid any cost accruals and unauthorized access, therefore a model function has been developed to mimic the retrieval and output from the user input in the GUI using a list and for loop function. 
*still in design processing. the code is not 100% complete*
The .py file is included in the repository and the two jpeg images are included to exhibit the input, ouput, and GUI. The jpeg image named *"TkinterGUI_DBStormwater_pic.jpg"* exhibits the GUI and the jpeg image named *"Input_OutputTkinterGUI.jpg"* exhibits the input from the GUI and its output in the console.
